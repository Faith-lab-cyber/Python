def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    # Check if the discount is 20% or higher
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        # Calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        # If the discount is less than 20%, return the original price
        return price

# Prompt the user to enter the original price and discount percentage
original_price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: $"))
discount_percent = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Calculate and print the final price
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percent)

# Output the final price
print(f"The final price is: ${final_price:.2f}")

If the original price is $100 and the discount is 20%, the output will be:
The final price is: $80.00
